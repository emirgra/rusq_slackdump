# Dump Command

## Description

Dump is the command that allows to dump the following type of
conversations:

- public and private channels with threads
- group messages (MPIM)
- private messages (DMs)
- individual threads

If the `-files` flag is set to `true`, it downloads file attachments as well. 

This is the original low-level mode that applies almost no transformations to
the API output mode of the Slackdump, and its behaviour would be familiar to
those who used it since the very first release.

### IDs or URLs Parameter

The `<IDs or URLs>` parameter should list the IDs of conversations or URLs of
the channel or thread that you'd like to download, for example `C051D4052` is
a channel ID, and `https://ora600.slack.com/archives/DHYNUJ00Y` is a URL of a
private conversation (DM). You can also use an input file with the list of IDs
or URLs or combine file with conversations and individual conversation links.

## Converting JSON Dumps to Other Formats

To convert the JSON file generated by `slackdump {{ .LongName }}` to other
formats (for example, text), use `slackdump format`.  Run `slackdump help
format` to learn mode.

For reference, in the old version this function was controlled by `-r` flag.

## Examples

### Dump one channel and a DM

This command will also enable file download.

```shell
slackdump {{ .LongName }} -files C051D4052 DHYNUJ00Y
```

### Dump channels listed in my_channels.txt

```shell
slackdump {{ .LongName }} @my_channels.txt
```

### Dump a single thread

Threads can be specified as a **URL**, or use a Slackdump-specific
**colon notation**.

URL:

```shell
slackdump {{ .LongName }} \
  https://ora600.slack.com/archives/C051D4052/p1665917454731419
```

Slackdump colon notation:

```shell
slackdump {{ .LongName }} C051D4052:1665917454.731419
```

### Combined all of the above

This example shows how you can combine different types of input. URL of the
thread is omitted for brevity:

```shell
slackdump {{ .LongName }} -files C051D4052 \
  DHYNUJ00Y \ 
  @my_channels.txt \
  C051D4052:1665917454.731419
```

_Windows users_: please note that "\" is used on UNIX systems to split the
single command across multiple lines.  The same command can be entered on a
single line with "\" removed, and will have the same effect as the one above.

## Viewing the Dump

You can use the `slackdump view <dump_file>` command to view the dump in the
browser.

Alternatively, you can use [Slackdump2HTML][1] by Dominic Dopplinger to convert
the dump to HTML format.
